# Settings

In Settings, you can edit your organization (Users and Subscriptions settings), environment (Routes and Recipient notifications settings) and device settings.

**Organization** is a group of users who share a subscription and collaborate on data in one or more environments. **Environments** let you represent teams within a single company or provide separate spaces for testing and productive use.

Examples:

- A large company (organization) with smaller teams (environments) working on different projects.
