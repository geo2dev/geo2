# Personal Data Removal Request

Organization admins have the ability to delete user accounts, organizations and environments.  The best way to have your user account removed from Geo2 is to ask your organization admin to do so.  If this is not possible or you are the sole organization admin, you can use the support request detailed below to ask for the removal of your personal data and your user account.  Once your user account is removed, there will be no personally-identifiable link between you and any data you have contributed in Geo2 such as POD's.

# Support Request

The Support menu option in the toolbar diplays a form in which you can detail any problem you are experiencing with the application.  Please write the summary of the issue in the Summary field, and describe the issue in detail in the Feedback field.  Please be as specific as possible.  The more details you provide, the faster we can solve your issue.

The following information will be useful:

1. What did you do step by step? On what page(s) did the issue happen?

2. Was the issue related to Hub, mobile app, or API?

3. What device do you use?

4. If the issue is related to a load/consignment/vehicle check, what is the load ID (or load key) / consignment ID (or consignment key) / vehicle check ID? Could be copied from the URL in the browser if the bug is on the Hub user interface.

5.  If the issue is related to a POD, what are the POD ID (if it's possible) and consignment ID (or consignment key)?

Do not hesitate to attach some files and screenshots if you think it will help to solve your question.

Once the form is filled in, press the `Submit` button.  A support request will be created in our service desk and you will receive an email acknowledgement with a link to the browser-based service desk interface for further communication.
