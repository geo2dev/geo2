# Introduction

Geo2 API at `https://api.geo2.com/v1/` allows you to link Geo2 with other systems, to both send data to the Hub and extract them from the Hub.  The web API allows you to create your own integrations.

For developer-level API reference, see [Geo2 API](https://api.geo2.com/v1/docs/html/).  This lets you review and try out available functions.  We recommend you establish a separate test environment to avoid the possibility of making unwanted changes to your production data.  Once you have tested your integration in a test environment, you can switch to credentials for your production environment to start using your integration in production.
