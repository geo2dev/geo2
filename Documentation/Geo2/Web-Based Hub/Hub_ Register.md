# Introduction

You need to register to become a user in [**Geo2 Hub**](https://hub.geo2.com/).  You have the option to authenticate either with an email address and password, mobile phone number or via an identity provider - Apple, Google, or Microsoft.

If you are joining an existing organization, the admin of that organization needs to add your user account and assign a subscription to you.  Learn how to [Hub: Accept Invitation](Hub_%20Accept%20Invitation.md)

If you have already registered, you can follow either of the [**Sign in**](https://hub.geo2.com/en-GB/auth/signin) links to proceed to sign in instead.

# Register Account Using Email

On [**Registration**](https://hub.geo2.com/en-GB/auth/register) page, you need to provide your full name. It will be shown to other users within the organization and to recipients on Proof of Delivery (POD) page.  If you want to provide your first and last names additionally, you can do it later in the [Hub: Profile](Hub_%20Profile.md).

After you have completed the requested details, press `Register` to create an account authenticated by Geo2, using the password you have specified.  Alternatively, you can press the buttons for other authentication providers in order to authenticate with your existing Google, Microsoft, or Apple identity instead. Also, you can register using your mobile phone number.

## Verify Email

Next, you will see a prompt for you to check your inbox for a verification code sent to the provided email address. You need to copy the code and paste it to the form in Hub:

If you have not received an email with a verification code, press the `Resend email` button, and a new code will be sent.

By pressing the Continue button, if the code provided is valid and you are not invited to any organization, you will be redirected to [Hub: Set Up Organization](Hub_%20Set%20Up%20Organization.md) page. **Free level subscription** will be assigned to you - **no payment details are required**.
