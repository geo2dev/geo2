| IBALDEV-2849 <br/> IBALDEV-3289                    | Web Hub: Map view/Load plan pages - Driver breaks <br/> Mobile app: Driver breaks                      | Added the possibility to schedule driver breaks alongside deliveries or collections. To add a driver break in the Hub, you need to go inside a load and press the "Actions" button. Select the "Add driver break" option and a prompt will appear allowing you to specify the duration of the break in minutes. The driver break will be added to the end of the stop list but you can easily adjust its position to suit your requirements. These breaks will be taken into account during load calibration and optimization, ensuring accurate updates to planned times for each stop. Additionally, drivers can view their scheduled breaks directly from the mobile app.                                                                                                                                                                |
| IBALDEV-4040 <br/> IBALDEV-4053 <br/> IBALDEV-4468 | Web Hub: Displaying package level failures on created POD page                                         | On the mobile app, when creating a POD for a consignment with pre-defined packages from the Hub, it is possible to select which packages have been delivered. For undelivered consignments, a prompt allows you to specify a failure reason code. The status of a POD is automatically changed to "Partially successful" when there is at least one undelivered package. The total count of delivered packages versus the planned count will be shown above the list of packages. The created POD is available for viewing on the Hub when clicking the POD status of the stop on the Load plan page, or when going inside the consignment detail. You will see the list of packages with the statuses - "Successful" or "Failed". For packages with the "Failed" status, the failure reason code will be displayed to identify the reason. |
| IBALDEV-4854                                       | Web Hub: Display yellow icon for "Partially successful" status of POD                                  | Added the yellow POD icon on the stop and consignment card to display the Partially successful status on the Load plan and Consignments page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| IBALDEV-4423                                       | Web Hub: Map view - Display total distance, duration, number of drivers and consignments for all loads | Added totals for planned distance, duration, number of drivers, vehicles, consignments, and loads on the Map view page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IBALDEV-4795                                       | Web Hub: Accept invitation notification                                                                | At present, when someone sends an invitation to join your organization, you receive the invitation via email. If you are logged in to the Hub, you will now also see the invitation notification. By clicking the Notification icon in the header toolbar, a dialog informs you of the invitation to join the organization. You can choose to either accept or reject the invitation by clicking the relevant button. Subsequently, the user's status within the organization will be adjusted accordingly. In the future, we plan to implement a notification history feature within the Hub, allowing you to review all of your past notifications.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
