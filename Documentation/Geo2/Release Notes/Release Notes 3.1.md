| IBALDEV-6748                    | Hub: Make depot optional for vehicle creation                                                                                                                                       | You can add or import vehicles without assigning them to a depot. If a route start is set to a specific depot, vehicles assigned to that depot will still appear on Create route and Route plan pages when assigning a vehicle to a route. However, vehicles without a depot will also be listed, allowing you to choose from all available options. <br/> Learn more about [Hub: Environment Settings](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Environment%20Settings.md). <br/> ***Note:** To use AI-powered route building, vehicles must still be assigned to a depot.*                                                                                                                                                               |
| IBALDEV-6820                    | Hub: Display stop numbers on the map clusters on Route plan page                                                                                                                    | When there are lots of orders going to the same or nearby address, they are grouped into clusters on Route plan map. You can hover over a cluster to see all the order keys in that area. Now, you will also see the stop numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 4) to quickly understand the delivery sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| IBALDEV-6674                    | Hub: Changes in filtering by depot due to change of the Depot field to the Route start/end                                                                                          | On Routes page when selecting route filtering by depot, a dropdown shows all available depots in the environment. When a depot is chosen, the system filters and displays only the routes where the selected depot is either the start or end point. For example, if "Depot 1" is selected, only routes starting or ending at "Depot 1" will be shown, while routes without this depot at either end will be excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IBALDEV-6624 <br/> IBALDEV-6627 | Mobile app: Load vehicle. Displaying of placement on stop card. <br/> Mobile app: "Set placement in vehicle" option on Add/Edit order pages. Add "Delivery instructions" field.     | Once a route is optimized, you can load your vehicle with the assigned delivery orders by selecting **Load vehicle** from the **Actions** button on Route view page. Stops appear in reverse order to help you load items that will be delivered last first, with collection orders excluded. For each stop, you can set parcel placement (e.g., "front right" or "left shelf") and optionally add photos. Press Done to save the placement, which can be updated later. Note that new photos will replace the old ones. The placement and photo count appear on the stop card, and full-size photos can be viewed in the Order details page. You can also set placement and upload photos when adding or editing an order. |
| IBALDEV-6626 <br/> IBALDEV-6625 | Mobile app: Changes in displaying information on Order details page. Displaying of required time slots. <br/> Mobile app: Display more information on stop cards on Route view page | You can now view **additional information** like package count, time at stop, required time windows, and delivery instructions directly **on the stop card** to stay informed on the go. Also, required time windows are now displayed on Order details page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IBALDEV-6682                    | Mobile app: Highlight required time windows in colours                                                                                                                              | **Required from and to time slot values are color-coded** based on how the planned time aligns with the required time window. If they match exactly, the time is shown in black. If the planned time differs but stays within the delivery ETA tolerance from Environment settings (e.g. ±30 minutes), it’s shown in orange. When the difference exceeds the tolerance, the time is highlighted in red. This helps you quickly spot timing issues and stay on schedule. <br/> Learn more about [Hub: Environment Settings](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Environment%20Settings.md).                                                                                                                                            |
| IBALDEV-6569                    | Mobile app: Road view toggle for displaying routes on Route view and Order details pages                                                                                            | A Road view toggle has been added to the bottom right corner of the map on Route view and Order details pages. When enabled, it shows the **actual road layout** instead of basic connecting lines, just like in Geo2 Hub. This view is turned on by default for calibrated or optimized routes. If you manually disable the Road view toggle, the app remembers this preference and doesn’t change it automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
