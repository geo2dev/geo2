| IBALDEV-3990                    | Web UI: Environment settings - Possibility to remove old photos from device storage                                                                                     | When you record photos for a POD or vehicle check, they are saved in your device's storage. To save your device memory, we added the new environment setting "Delete photos older than...". By default, 30 days is selected. It means that recorded photos older than 30 days will be deleted automatically. If you want to save these photos, select the "None" value in the environment settings. Automatic deleting of old photos from the device storage will be implemented on the mobile app in the next release.                                                                                                                          |
| IBALDEV-4806 <br/> IBALDEV-4807 | Web UI: Redirect user to Accept invitation page after page refresh <br/> Web UI: Redirect user to Accept invitation page after selecting organization in header toolbar | When somebody invites you to their organization, the invitation email will be sent to your email. The invitation notification will then be displayed in the Hub. Additionally, when you sign in to the Hub or manually refresh the page in the browser, you will be redirected to the Invitation page, where you can also accept an invitation to the organization. Organizations that you have been invited to are visible in the Organizations selector in the header toolbar. By clicking on the organization, you will be redirected to the Invitation page. Therefore, there are now many easy ways to accept invitations to organizations. |
| IBALDEV-4908                    | Web UI: Add Partially successful status to consignments filtering by POD status                                                                                         | With the previous release, the new status for consignments "Partially successful" was added to POD's. This is useful when you want to show that some of the packages have not been delivered/collected. When a POD for a consignment is created, it is also visible in the Hub. You can filter consignments by POD status on the Consignments page, Load plan, and Map view pages. Select filtering by POD status and then choose the Partially successful option. Consignments with a Partially successful POD status will then be displayed.                                                                                                   |
| IBALDEV-4772                    | API/Web UI: address geoLocation and geoLocationAccuracy are optional                                                                                                    | Added the possibility to create consignments via the Hub and API when there is no geolocation, e.g. when the address is not correct. The geolocation icon on the stop on the Load plan page and inside of consignment details will be grey to show the mission geolocation. The latitude and longitude for such an address will be "null", it will be highlighted on the map with a grey marker. It is not possible to optimize/calibrate such loads where a stop does not have geolocation. If you try to do it, you will see the error message "Not possible to run load <optimization / calibration> because of missing geolocation on stop". |
