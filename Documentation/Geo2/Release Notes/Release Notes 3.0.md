You can now explore in details which features are available on both the mobile app and the web-based Hub across all levels. We also offer three paid subscription levels: **Pro**, **Advanced**, and **Enterprise**. Here’s how the changes will affect existing customers: <br/><ul><li><p>Customers on the <strong>Essential</strong> level will be moved to <strong>Pro</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Customers on the <strong>Advanced</strong> level will remain on the same level.</p></li><li><p>Customers on the <strong>Premium</strong> level will be moved to <strong>Enterprise</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Customers already on the <strong>Enterprise</strong> level will remain unchanged.</p></li></ul> No action is required. These updates will be applied automatically. <br/> Additionally, we're **bringing back the Free level**. If a subscription expires, you can choose to extend it or continue using Geo2 for free with one user per organization. Free level is supported by ads. <br/> Learn more about [Hub: Organization Settings](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Organization%20Settings.md). |
