Previously, it could only be done one consignment at a time, however, we will now allow for multiple at once. To move consignments between loads, you need to select stops on the Load plan page, click on the Modify button → Move to load, and choose the load where you want to move consignments. |
| IBALDEV-3113                    | Web UI: Bulk deletion of consignments from load                       | Added the ability to select multiple consignments and remove them from a load, all the same time. To remove consignments from a load, you need to select stops on the Load plan page, and click on the Remove button.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IBALDEV-3827 <br/> IBALDEV-3828 | Web UI: Peak Vehicle Weight and Volume charts                         | Added the ability to analyse the Peak Vehicle Weight and the Peak Vehicle Volume of different vehicles over a chosen period. This will help you understand whether you are utilising the maximum capacities of your vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| IBALDEV-3830                    | Web UI: Loads by Area chart                                           | Added the ability to analyse which of your areas are the busiest and have the most loads delivered to them. This will allow for effective and tactical planning in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| IBALDEV-3884                    | Web UI: Tooltips for charts                                           | Added the explanation about how the charts are calculated for the Loads by Status, Loads by Vehicle, Started Load Driver Position, CO2 Emissions, and CO2 Emissions Per Consignment charts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IBALDEV-3930                    | Web UI: Possibility to select consignments for load building          | Added the ability to select which consignments you would like to run the Load Building feature on. Previously, you would only be able to run the Load Building functionality on all consignments at once, however, you will now have the flexibility to select individual consignments. This is useful if you do not want to perform Load Building on certain consignments.                                |
| IBALDEV-4063                    | Web UI: Make minimizing vehicles the default option for load building | Made "Minimize vehicles" on the Load building popup the default option. This will allow to create loads with more consignments but fewer vehicles for more efficient use of vehicles and cost savings.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
