| IBALDEV-4085 | Web UI: Map view - Drag-and-drop of load cards                                                                    | Added the possibility to drag-and-drop load cards on the Map view page to change their order on the page. It's useful when you want to see changes for the load on the map without scrolling up the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| IBALDEV-4090 | Web UI: Map view - Drag-and-drop consignments between loads                                                       | Added the possibility to drag-and-drop consignments between loads on the Map view page. Now you can select multiple consignments from one load using Ctrl/Command + Click or Shift + Click and move them to another load to a specific position. All changes will be automatically saved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| IBALDEV-3835 | Web UI: Areas overview chart                                                                                      | Added a new Areas Overview chart on the Dashboard page. With the new chart, you can analyse the overall effectiveness of deliveries to different areas by categorisation them into on-time, late, and early deliveries. Consignments will be categorized taking into consideration the time spent at stops, delivery ETA tolerance, and areas to which they are assigned. If a consignment doesn't have an assigned area, we take it from a load.                                                                                                   |
| IBALDEV-3836 | Web UI: On-Time Performance chart                                                                                 | Added a new On-Time Performance chart on the Dashboard page. This chart allows you to track the overall performance for all drivers based on early, on-time, late, and undelivered consignments. You can check either the summarised information in the pie chart, or day-by-day data using the line chart. Consignments are calculated as on-time based on the time spent at stops and delivery ETA tolerance. To calculate the number of undelivered consignments, we take into consideration consignments with failed PODs or not delivered yet. |
| IBALDEV-4370 | Web UI: Environment settings -> Driving hours for load building                                                   | Added the Maximum driving hours setting to the Environment settings for a load building. By default, it's 8:00 hours but you can change it to any other value, including 7:30, etc. Next time when you open a load building dialog, you will see this default value taken from the Environment settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| IBALDEV-4016 | Mobile app: POD page redesign                                                                                     | To increase the comfort of usage of our app and the speed of a POD creation, moved all information on a single page. Instead of 3 tabs, you will see all the details like contact information, packages, photos, and a signature in one place. You can scroll the page up if you forget to add something to a consignee's contact information or remarks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| IBALDEV-4198 | Mobile app: Possibility to re-upload pictures/signature                                                           | Added the possibility to re-upload pictures/signatures to POD's and vehicle checks in case when you have a bad internet connection. Thus, you can give one more push for not uploaded pictures/signatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IBALDEV-4237 | Mobile app: Load stop add > Pre-populate consignment fields when an existing key is selected                      | Added pre-populating consignment fields when an existing key is selected while adding a consignment to a load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IBALDEV-4408 | Mobile app: Confirmation dialog if user tries to add consignment to load that is already assigned to another load | Added a confirmation dialog if a user tries to add a consignment to a load that is already assigned to another load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IBALDEV-3965 | Mobile app: Possibility to remove data from "select" fields                                                       | Added the possibility to remove (blank) data from the select fields during load creation/editing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
