For all environments by default, we display initially the next charts: Loads by Status, Loads by Vehicle, Started Load Driver Position, and CO2 Emissions.                                                                 |

By hovering over the chart, there is the Delete icon to remove the chart. To add it again, you need to click on one of the next buttons: Loads, Consignments, Vehicles.                                        |

To calculate the number of delivered consignments, we take into consideration consignments with successful PODs and in-load completed consignments without PODs. The filtering is by the consignment completion date.               |
| IBALDEV-3822 | Web UI: Undelivered Consignments chart                                              | Added the Undelivered Consignments charts on the Dashboard page. To calculate the number of undelivered consignments, we take into consideration consignments with the planned date with failed PODs or not delivered yet. The filtering is by the consignment planned date.                      |
| IBALDEV-3823 | Web UI: Consignments by Load Assignment chart                                       | Added the Consignments by Load Assignment chart on the Dashboard page. To calculate the number of consignments by load assignment, we take into consideration only consignments that have the required date. The filtering is by the consignment required date.                                   |
| IBALDEV-2982 | Web UI: Consignment import - add column for "Time at stop"                          | Added the Time at stop field for consignments import to be considered during the import with a load generation option. However, if you decide to not generate a load, these values will be lost.                                                                                                  |
| IBALDEV-3416 | Web UI, API: Not possible to choose expired Area and Channel                        | Added the logic of no possibility to choose area and channel for a consignment or load creation if they are expired. Please note that active to/from dates are optional for an area and channel entities so if you have not set up it, they will be always valid.                                 |
| IBALDEV-3455 | Web UI: Infinite scrolling on Consignments and Loads list                           | Added infinite scrolling on the Consignments and Loads pages to make the search process faster and easier.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IBALDEV-3903 | Web UI: Consignments import with same load but different trip numbers               | Improved the logic of consignments import so if you import consignments (with enabled load generation option) with the same load key but different trip numbers, several loads will be created with the keys: (loadKey)\_(tripNumber).                                                            |
