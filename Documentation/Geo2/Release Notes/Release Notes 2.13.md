| IBALDEV-3806 | Web UI: On-Time Consignments by Driver chart                  | Added the possibility to analyze the accuracy of delivery time by a driver to monitor the overall performance of your team, and therefore level of customer satisfaction with your services. To calculate the number of on-time consignments, we take into account both in-load consignments with POD's and consignments created by ad-hoc POD's. This chart proves valuable even if you don't have the complete load planning process. Consignments with POD's will be categorized as early, on-time, or late, taking into consideration the time spent at stops and delivery ETA tolerance. |

This will allow for effective and tactical planning in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
