It is enabled when "Required from" and/or "Required to" dates/times are set inside at least one consignment assigned to a load in the Web Hub or via API. By pressing it, the system will generate the most efficient route, factoring in time windows to help reduce costs and save time. You can also optimize specific stops of your route. By selecting a few neighbouring stops from the list and clicking "Optimize selection with time windows", the system will perform a partial optimization, considering only the time windows of the selected stops. You can still run a standard route optimization based on distance and traffic alone, skipping any time constraints, by pressing "Optimize without time windows". <br/> Load optimization with time windows is not applied to load building. Once loads are created, you can go inside them and optimize with time windows. After a load optimization, you remain in control. You can manually adjust the stop sequence using drag-and-drop, and press Save to apply automatic recalibration. |

While the driver retains the ability to start and complete a load, participants will have access to a load to check the list of stops and create POD's for them. Currently, this feature is available in the Web Hub and API. Mobile app support will be included in version 2.32, set to release in the next few weeks. For load tracking, only the main driver’s geolocation will be displayed.

On the right side of the page, you will now see a map displaying the selected depot, making it easier to visualize the start and end points of your load. Each field on the page will feature a question icon, providing helpful tooltips when you hover over them, explaining the purpose of the field. For the Depot, Vehicle, and Area fields, there will be the Add button in the tooltip, allowing you to quickly navigate to Environment settings to add new depots, vehicles, or areas as needed. Additionally, the Create/Update button will be pinned at the bottom of the page, ensuring it is always within reach, eliminating the need to scroll and find it. These updates are designed to make load management faster and more intuitive for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
