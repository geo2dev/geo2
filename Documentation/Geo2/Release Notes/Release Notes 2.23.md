| IBALDEV-4819 | Web UI: Import - put default depot when Depot field is blank                                        | Added the default depot logic to a consignment when you try to import consignments without providing depots for them. As it is a required field for a consignment creation, instead of showing the error message, we add the default depot for such a consignment.                                                                                             |

| IBALDEV-4959 | Web UI: Create default failure reason code for environments                                         | Added the default failure reason code for new environments and existing ones if they don't have any codes yet. Failure reason code is required for the failed POD creation. To support the proper work of the POD creation, it will not be possible to delete the last failure reason code in the environment.                                                 |

By default, the consignor information is the same as the environment address but you can change it for each individual consignment.                                                                                                                               |

| IBALDEV-4055 | Mobile app: Displaying Phone/Mobile phone fields on POD creation page for in-load consignment       | Added displaying of the Phone/Mobile phone fields on the Create POD page for in-load consignments if this information was provided. It is not possible to edit. If these fields are blank, they will not be displayed.                                                                                                                                         |
| IBALDEV-4869 | Mobile app: Create POD - handle case when there are no failure reason codes in Environment settings | Added the warning message on the Create POD page when you try to create a failed or partially successful POD without having any failure reason code in the Environment settings.                                                                                                                                                                               |
