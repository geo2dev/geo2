| IBALDEV-6812                    | Mobile app: Quick navigation between stops on Order details page                                                             | You will now see navigation arrows on Order details page above the bottom-screen dialog to quickly switch between route stops. These arrows move dynamically with the bottom sheet as it changes height during scrolling. Next to the arrows, the stop numbers of the previous and next stops are displayed, helping you know which stops you can navigate to. The left arrow is hidden on the first stop, and the right arrow is hidden on the last stop, ensuring navigation options are only shown when applicable. If there is only one stop in the route, no arrows are displayed at all.                                                                                                                                       |

Display refresh POD icon                     | You can now see a “refresh” POD icon on Order details and Route view pages near each stop card to indicate the status of photos or signatures pending upload. Once they are successfully uploaded, the icon changes color to reflect a POD status: green for successful, yellow for partial successful, and red for failed. On Order details page, a POD icon is clickable, allowing you to view POD details. If there is only one POD for the order, clicking the icon opens the POD details screen directly; if multiple POD's exist, a dialog appears to select which POD to view. From the POD details screen, users can navigate back to Order details page. POD's for this order from other routes are not shown in this view. |
