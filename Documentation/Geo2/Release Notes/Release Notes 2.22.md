| IBALDEV-2983 <br/> IBALDEV-4000 <br/> IBALDEV-4030                    | Mobile app: Improved package scanning and validation on the Create POD page                     | The improved package scanning functionality on the Create POD page serves several purposes. For consignments with pre-defined packages, scanning allows you to efficiently mark packages as delivered. Un-scanned packages from the list will be automatically marked as undelivered. Additionally, scanning verifies that the selected package is associated with the consignment. If not, an error message will prompt you, ensuring accuracy in delivery confirmation and minimizing errors. For consignments without pre-defined packages (such as those created via an ad-hoc POD) scanning enables you to seamlessly add packages to the consignment. Once added, they will be automatically marked as delivered. In summary, the package scanning and validation feature not only facilitates accurate delivery confirmation but also enhances efficiency, streamlining the management of both pre-defined and ad-hoc consignments. |

This is useful for making checks on the vehicle during a load. The ad-hoc vehicle check will be uploaded to the Geo2 Hub unallocated to a load. Press the Plus button on the Home or Checks page to be redirected to the vehicle check creation. You can select a vehicle, record photos, and create a signature for it. Custom fields will be displayed on this page if you have set them up in your environment settings. Ad-hoc vehicle checks will be displayed in the vehicle checks history both in the mobile app and Geo2 Hub under the title "No load".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It can be controlled from the environment settings → Devices. The purpose of it is to save the device storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The latitude and longitude for such an address will be "null", it will be highlighted on the map with a grey marker. It is not possible to optimize/calibrate such loads where a stop does not have geolocation. If you try to do it, you will see the error message "Not possible to run load <optimization / calibration> because of missing geolocation on stop". It will not be possible to use the Navigate button for such consignments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
