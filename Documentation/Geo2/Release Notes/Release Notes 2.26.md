| IBALDEV-5267 <br/> IBALDEV-5263 | Web UI: Redesign of Public tracking page <br/> Web UI: Use environment logo on public tracking and POD pages                        | Redesigned the Public tracking page that makes it easier for consignees to track orders with essential information. Your environment logo from the Environment settings will be displayed at the top of the page, while the Geo2 logo has been removed from the header and email layout. The same logo will be displayed on the public POD page for consignees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IBALDEV-5293 <br/> IBALDEV-5266 | Web UI/API: Allow POD notifications on consignment level <br/> Web UI/API: Allow public tracking notifications on consignment level | Public tracking and POD notifications can be enabled by default for all consignments in the Environment settings. Additionally, added the flexibility to choose whether to send them to individual consignees. You can uncheck sending Public tracking and POD notifications inside a specific consignment or via your integration with the Geo2 API. This feature is particularly useful for providing tailored communication, ensuring that each consignee receives the most appropriate form of notification based on their preferences or needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IBALDEV-5177                    | Web UI: Add new Delivery ETA token to Public tracking                                                                               | Added the new "Delivery ETA" token for Public tracking emails and SMS notifications. When it is sent to a consignee, the token will be automatically changed to the planned date and time considering delivery ETA tolerance from the Environment settings. For example, "Your order will be delivered on <DELIVERY\_ETA>" will be replaced with "Your order will be delivered on 10/07/2024 between 09:09 and 11:09."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IBALDEV-5261                    | Web UI: Add "Registered" and "Planning" statuses to Public tracking notifications                                                   | Added the new statuses for sending Public tracking notifications - Registered and Planning. "Registered" means an email/SMS must be sent once a consignment is created/registered. "Planning" means an email/SMS must be sent when a load to which a consignment is assigned has the status "Planning".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| IBALDEV-5160 <br/> IBALDEV-5161 | Web UI: Organization settings - import users <br/> Web UI: Add asterisks and text tooltips for columns for user imports             | In the Users tab under Organization settings, added the possibility to import user information. This feature is particularly beneficial if you have a large number of users and want to save time adding them to the Hub. To import users, click the "Import" button to open an import spreadsheet. You can enter user data manually, copy and paste from your CSV/Excel file, or upload your CSV/Excel file by clicking the upload icon in the spreadsheet. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (\*) near the column titles. To understand the purpose of each column, hover over the top of each column title for text help. After providing the user information and pressing the "Import" button in the spreadsheet, you need to select environments to which they will be added and assign a subscription. Invitation emails will be sent to all imported users. |
| IBALDEV-5171                    | Web UI: Simplifying organization and environment creation                                                                           | When registering a new account not yet linked to any organizations, you must first set up the organization and environment settings before using Geo2. Now, added the option to opt for the express setup. This option automatically creates the organization, environment, and depot for you. All you need to do is provide the organization address. Once this is completed, you will be redirected to the Consignments page to start creating orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IBALDEV-5254                    | Web UI: Change Create button on the Load creation page                                                                              | Added the possibility to redirect you to the Load plan page after the load creation in the Hub. The option to go to the Loads list will be saved as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IBALDEV-5327                    | Web UI: Add (\*) to fields on Consignor tab inside consignment                                                                      | Added asterisks ( \* ) near the titles of the required fields on the Consignor tab inside a consignment to identify which information is mandatory to fill in, and which is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
