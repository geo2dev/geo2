| IBALDEV-4256       | Web UI: Map view - Add consignments without assigned loads                    | Added the ability to add consignments not assigned to a load yet to the Map view page. Press the "Add consignments" button at the top of the page, select consignments in the list, and drag-and-drop them either to an existing load or to the "No load" card. Consignments added to the "No load" card can serve multiple purposes, such as the creation of a new load or moving them among existing loads.                                |
| IBALDEV-4260       | Web UI: Map view - Select stops on map                                        | Added the possibility to select stops one by one using Ctrl+Click or by drawing an area using Shift+Click to group stops based on various criteria you want to use such as proximity, delivery schedules, customer preferences, etc. You can move selected stops to other loads by clicking the "Move to load" button at the top left side of the map to optimize your route plans, minimize travel time, and maximize resource utilization. |
| IBALDEV-4610 <br/> | Web UI: New data tokens for body and subject of email/SMS                     | Tokens are used for SMS and emails both for POD and Public tracking notifications. The COMPANY\_NAME token now means environment address company name while the ENVIRONMENT\_NAME token means environment name itself. These tokens as well as the CONSIGNMENT\_KEY can now be used in the Subject line so you can notify your customers about the created POD or a consignment to be delivered yet.                                         |
| IBALDEV-4424       | Web UI: Load plan page - Freeze Actions button at top of page                 | Anchored the "Actions" button at to the top of the stops list on the Load plan page, remaining visible as you scroll. This feature proves especially handy when dealing with a longer list of stops, sparing you the need to constantly scroll back to the page's top. Quick access to the "Actions" button with options such as optimization, calibration, stop reversal, etc. is assured, facilitating more efficient planning processes.  |
| IBALDEV-4376       | Web UI, API: Products - currency is not required, quantity is required        | Changed the required and optional fields for the products when adding them to a consignment. The Currency field is now optional while the Quantity field is mandatory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| IBALDEV-4597       | Web UI/API: Consignment details - Increase instructions limits to 300 symbols | Increased the limit for the Planning and Consignment instructions fields inside of a consignment to 300 symbols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| IBALDEV-4600       | Web UI: Stop card redesign for large screens                                  | Provided small UI changes for the stop card on the Load plan page for large screens to make it more user-friendly and consistent with other screen sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
