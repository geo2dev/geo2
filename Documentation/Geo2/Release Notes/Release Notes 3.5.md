It allows you to work with the map even if you don’t have any routes or orders created yet. From Map view page, you can easily create new routes or orders or add existing ones to visualize and manage them together in one place. <br/> Learn more about [Hub: Map View](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Map%20View.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

You can add existing routes or orders to display them on the map or create new ones directly from the Map view. The Create route button opens a dialog that auto-generates key details and starts the route in Planning status, prefilled with default depot and vehicle if available. The Create order button opens a dialog where you can search for or manually enter an address, fine-tune it on the map, and add contact details and instructions. Once created, the order appears under No route or is added directly to the selected route, ready to be managed on the map. |
