| IBALDEV-5075                                                                             | Web UI: Highlight required time slots on stop cards considering delivery ETA tolerance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | With the previous release, added the possibility to add the "Required from" and "Required to" date/time for each consignment. The time slots will be displayed on stop cards on the Load plan page. If the planned date/time doesn’t match the required date/time, it will be highlighted in orange or red. The color indicates how far off the planned time is from the required time, based on the delivery ETA tolerance settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| IBALDEV-5165                                                                             | Web UI: Manual export of consignment data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Added the possibility to export consignment data directly from the Consignments page. This feature is available for consignments created in the last 7 or 30 days. Use filters to narrow down the list by your chosen parameters and click the "Export CSV" button. A CSV file containing the consignment and partially its load data will be downloaded to your PC. You can also select specific consignments for export by using the checkboxes on the consignment cards. This allows you to update consignment data in your system without needing full integration with Geo2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This feature is especially useful if you have a large number of vehicles and want to save time adding them to the Hub. To import vehicles, press the "Import" button, which will open an import spreadsheet. You can enter vehicle data by typing it in, copying and pasting from your own Excel file, or uploading your Excel file by clicking the upload icon in the spreadsheet. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (\*) near the column titles. For convenience, hover over each column title for text help to understand its purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| IBALDEV-5163                                                                             | Web UI: Add the Scroll up button to return to top of consignments, loads, vehicle checks lists                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Added the Scroll up button on Consignments, Loads, and Vehicle checks pages. When you scroll down Consignments/Loads/Vehicles checks lists, those located at the top of the list are not visible anymore, so you have to scroll up the page to see them again. By clicking on the button, the list is automatically scrolled back to the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A prompt will appear, allowing you to enter a failure reason code and specify the quantity of products that failed out of the planned total. The failure reason code from the products-level will be populated to the general POD level. If some products fail, the POD status will update to "Partially Successful." If all fail, it will change to "Failed." You can also select a POD status with a failure reason code first, and then deselect products accordingly. This way, the failure reason code from the general POD level will be applied to each product automatically, saving you time. Failed products will be also visible in the POD history in the mobile app. Later, these failures will also be visible in the Hub, under consignment details, ensuring complete transparency and tracking. |

Scanning allows you to efficiently mark packages as delivered. Un-scanned packages from the list will be automatically marked as undelivered. Additionally, scanning verifies that the selected package is associated with the consignment. If not, an error message will prompt you, ensuring accuracy in delivery confirmation and minimizing errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
