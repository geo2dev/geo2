| IBALDEV-4688 <br/> IBALDEV-4689 | Hub: Environment settings -> Devices - Add Minimum photos field <br/> Mobile app: Consider Max and Min photos settings for POD and Vehicle check | In environment settings, in addition to the maximum number of photos, added the possibility to define the minimum number of photos for POD's and vehicle checks.

| IBALDEV-3994                    | Mobile app: Package level failures for consignment POD with pre-defined packages                                                                 | When creating a POD for a consignment with pre-defined packages, you will now be able to select which packages have been delivered. For undelivered packages, a prompt will allow you to specify a failure reason code. The status of a POD will be automatically changed to "Partially successful" if there is at least one undelivered package. The total count of delivered packages versus the planned count will be shown above the list of packages. Later, this possibility will be also available for a consignment with no pre-defined packages, for example ad-hoc POD's. In a future release, package-level failures will be shown when viewing a POD both in the mobile app and the Hub. |
